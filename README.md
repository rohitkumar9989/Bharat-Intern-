## Project Overview
This project showcases two different machine learning tasks:

* Wine Quality Testing: In this part of the project, we use TensorFlow with the gradient tape framework to analyze and predict the quality of wines based on various features.

* House Price Prediction: In the second part, we employ TensorFlow to predict house prices using a dataset of real estate listings.
