## Project Overview
This project showcases two different machine learning tasks:

* Wine Quality Testing: In this part of the project, we use TensorFlow with the gradient tape framework to analyze and predict the quality of wines based on various features.

* House Price Prediction: In the second part, we employ TensorFlow to predict house prices using a dataset of real estate listings.

## Setup
Before diving into the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow
* Jupyter Notebook
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-Learn
Clone the repository to your local machine (If needed to test and run);

``` git clone https://github.com/rohitkumar9989/Bharat-Inter ```
## Data Sources
* Wine Quality Testing Data: The wine dataset was sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009](here) and contains information about various wines, such as volatile acidity, pH, and quality.
* House Price Prediction Data: The real estate dataset was obtained from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction](Kaggle) and includes property features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and price.

## Wine Quality Testing
Explore the 'wine_price_prediciton' folder for detailed documentation and Jupyter notebooks on wine quality testing. You'll find code, explanations, and visualizations related to this task.

## House Price Prediction
Navigate to the 'house_price_prediction' directory for the house price prediction section. Here, you'll find notebooks, code, and visuals regarding house price predictions.

## Data Visualization
n both sections, I prioritized data visualization for better understanding. We use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful plots and charts that provide a deeper look into the datasets. 📊📈

Finally I would thank Bharat Intern for providing this opportunity... 💪💪
